Tools for Clusterio thats make easy to manage it!

I currently create some Script for Clusterio to Manage Server kinda easily.

The Editor has already 2 Tabs there a ready to go! (*You probably have to correct the Clusterio PATH for the Folder.
The Manager is still in early process but it should works normaly. (*Same with the PATH here)

You need [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) to run the Scripts.
Please report [Issues here](https://github.com/SkiperTheBoss/Tools-for-Clusterio/issues).

**Planned**
 - **Editor**
     - ToolTips when you go over the Text or Fields.
     - Added option to select your clusterio Folder.
     - Whitelist (*will be able to copy to all instances)
     - Banlist (*same here)
     - Settings
  - **Manager** (rename Launcher to Manager)
     - will be able to Start / Stop evey single Instance.
     - more comming soon...
