Tools for Clusterio thats make easy to manage it!

I currently create some Script for Clusterio to Manage Server kinda easily.

The Editor has already 2 Tabs there a ready to go! (*You probably have to correct the Clusterio PATH for the Folder.
The Launcher is still in early process but it should works normaly. (*Same with the PATH here)

You need [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) to run the Scripts.
